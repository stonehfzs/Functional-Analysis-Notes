## 🔍 Overview

These notes were created based on a Complex Analysis course at Ocean University of China. The content is designed for a 4-hour weekly course format. Please note that due to its specialized organization, these materials are not recommended for first-time learners of the subject. Also, to make the structure of this notes much better, some part of materials that are not in the course would be put in.

## 📑 Document Structure

### Covering Topics

The notes are organized into the following chapters:

1. **Complex Numbers and Complex Functions** - Basic introduction of complex numbers
2. **Analytic Functions** - How to determine an analytic function and its basic properties
3. **Cauchy Integral** - Cauchy integral theorem and its applications
4. **Taylor Series of Analytic Functions** - Taylor serires theory of complex functions
5. **Laurent Series** - Laurent series theory of complex functions and isolated singularity
6. **Residue and its applications** - Residue theorem and calculation of real integral 
7. **Conformal Mappings** - Conformal mapping and its geometric understanding
8. **Harmonic Functions** - Introduction of Harmonic functions
